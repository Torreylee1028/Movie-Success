# Movie Success
## Statistical Analysis with R

### Summary
The success of movies project was my first data science project where I applied one component of the data science process, statistical analysis. This analysis was also conducted entirely in the R programming language. This project allowed me create graphs in R and learn how to interpret those statistical graphs. I also attempted my first linear and multiple regression models to see if I could predict the success of a movie by predicting its profit.
